# Noter

This application made by using the elements in the MEAN stack and following its model, handles user accounts and offers the possibility to CRUD notes, todos and reminders.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Clone the repository from here:

```
git clone https://github.com/CatalinMB/Noter
```

Make sure you have all the elements in the MEAN stack, which are:

* [Mongodb]
* [Express]
* [Angular 4+]
* [NodeJS]


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Run the following command to add the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the -prod flag for a production build. To build the client-side part of the application, run the following command:

```
ng build
```

Afterwards, start the server (using Nodemon): 

```
nodemon server.js
```
